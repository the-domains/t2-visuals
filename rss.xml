            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Atmo Sfera Platterless Turntable Spins Vinyl in the Air</h1><p>Chicago's Gramovox already defied gravity with their vertical Floating Record Player, and now Italian start-up Audio Deva offers their own "upside-down" take on a turntable. It eschews the basic design that has "remained the same for about a century."</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4e0e9422dc8b38aa4896d911f5d202f6/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=1162&cropwidth=1503&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F9fb337561fce986fe123f7a74eb6e8ea6a39834a.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
